# Homework-2-Challenge

## üìù Notes
Thesis/Motivation:
Our motivation was to create a portfolio showcasing my skills as a developer and as a team player. I showcase my bio as well as some
pictures showing myself engaging in physical activity. Along with that I had images of my resume, coursework in college, and projects. 
Included are links to my various online links.

How we accomplished:
We created a heading showing my name and my portfolio, as well as a list format semantic elements 
that would have sections indicating About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Me.

Then we link images of myself using img src to show myself in action.

Next are 3 flexboxes that include:
 an About Me Section with a lengthy bio

 a Portfolio section that has my resume, coursework, and projects

 and a Contact me Section list of my LinkedIn, Github, and contact information.


 With a footer showing tribute to the instructors and with help from myself.



User Story
